### Projects

- [Semi-supervised Chameleon Clustering](https://github.com/hon-gyu/semi-supervised-chameleon-clustering): An implementation of semi-supervised Chameleon clustering, capable of integrating must-link and cannot-link constraints at various levels of hierarchy to guide the clustering process.
- [Model Fingerprint](https://github.com/hon-gyu/model-fingerprint): A model-agnostic method to decompose predictions into linear, nonlinear and pairwise interaction effects. It can be helpful in feature selection and model interpretation.
- [Using LSTM Model for Meta-labeling](https://github.com/hon-gyu/meta-labeling-and-lstm): An implementation that applies meta-labeling to minute-frequency stock data, utilizing LSTM as the primary model for price direction prediction, which forms the basis for a trading strategy augmented by a secondary meta-labeling layer to filter false positives and improve risk-return metrics.
- [Semi-supervised Hedge Fund Clustering](https://github.com/hon-gyu/semi-supervised-hedge-fund-clustering): A semi-supervised clustering method utilizing tree distance for enhanced hierarchical classification of funds in fund of funds analysis.
- [Hierarchical Tree Distance](https://github.com/hon-gyu/hierarchical-tree-distance): An implementation of the AKB tree distance, a measure designed to quantify the similarity between classes within a hierarchical label tree. Adept at emphasizing the importance of higher hierarchy errors, utilizing the taxonomy's inherent structure instead of simply flattening the hierarchy in traditional.

### Micro Projects

- [PyTorch Model Interpretation by Shap](https://github.com/hon-gyu/pytorch-shap): An implemention of using PyTorch model in [shap](https://github.com/shap/shap) framework, which is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. Created shap.Explanation object for PyTorch models to facilitate visualisation using a unified interface.
